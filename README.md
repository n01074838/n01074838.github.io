*Proposal for the development of Wireless Mesh Network*

Prepared by Pramit Roy  
*Computer Engineering Technology Student*  
n01074838.github.io

**Executive Summary**

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to develop a mesh network using Digimesh protocol and a DMX transmitter and
receiver. The hardware will include an XBee 900hp RF module connected with XBee
Grove development board for communicating with a computer and use XCTU software
to send and receive packets. I will also be working on developing a DMX
transmitter and receiver using Feather 32u4 radio (rfm69hcw) and Arduino UNO to
generate DMX signal. I will be collaborating with Humber College Prototype Lab.
In this winter semester I will be working with Kristian Medri and Vlad Porcila
from the Prototype Lab.

**Background**

The problems solved by these projects are creating a simple mesh network using
Digimesh protocol to extend the connectivity range using three different RF
modules where one module will relay data between the other two RF modules. In
addition to this the other project will be solving a problem which includes
transmitting and receiving a DMX signal over 512 channels.

In modern communication system monitoring devices wirelessly over long distances
is a challenge. Often in order to do so we require different type of network
topology, mesh is one of them. Creating a mesh connection requires connected
devices to be able to relay information from node to node. Doing so with a 900
MHz RF module can allow long range communication among multiple devices.

DMX signal is often used to control stage lighting and effects. Normally DMX
signals are transmitted over cable connection, but to be able to do so
wirelessly in a reliable way adds much more flexibility to the system.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content” [@6169161] and have found and read [@7352296] which provides
insight into similar efforts.

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build is to be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the winter term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

**Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for developing a
mesh network of 900Mhz RF modules and DMX signal transmission wirelessly. This
is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills developed in our program
to create a collaborative IoT capstone project demonstrating my ability to learn
how to support projects such as the initiative described by [@7352296]. I
request approval of this project.
