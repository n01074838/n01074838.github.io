	<ul>
	<li>As of today (10/11/2016) We are following the Project Schedule and achieved some of the tasks before the due date.<br>
	Components purchasing and their assembly were all done ahead of time given on the schedule. </li>
	<li>Current objectives are (according to the approved proposal) PCB fabrication and Group Placard.
	PCB is soldered already and checked on any malfunctioning in the Prototype Lab. Group Placard in process
	and will be finished on time.</li>	
	<li>Problems/Solutions and Opportunities/Modofications</li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Problem:</b> During PCB assembly, I have accidentally soldered all 3 transistors together which would cause the board
			to short circuit and cause malfunction in the future. One of the routes was not working properly <br>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Used desolrdering pump to remove solder from transistors and connected bridges with the wire</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Financial Updates:</b> All of the components were met with planned financial needs. No extra coponents were purchased</li>

    <li>Solder together a sensor hat (parts provided from J206) for a Raspberry Pi 3 (that you purchase). This Broadcom development platform was chosen for a number of reasons. Let us start with platform requirements, it should be able to be used to create a small programmable device capable of connecting to enterprise Wi-Fi, bluetooth, and I2C. The NXP HCS12 can have a network stack loaded on it, but then not be able to do much more and thus the device would require multiple HCS12s for this purpose causing an increase in cost. Likewise with Atmel based Arduinos, connecting them to enterprise Wi-Fi is not straighforward. TI's beaglebone shows promise as an alternative however you would need to redesign the sensor hat in order to be compatible.</li>
	<li>Kits of sensor hat parts should be available in J206 (hours posted outside the door) to get started before the term starts if you like.</li>
	<li>Here are some videos on soldering: <a

	<li>I have my Pi 3 in this case <a href="http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html">http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html</a> and we bought USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct. Note that USB webcams are more economical and robust than pi specific ones. Paul Moggach's Raspberry Pi Technical Notes which give some idea of how to use the network adaptor and more extensive programming examples, than the simple program that should blink the (red-green) LED that I emailed, are available via login at: <a
