abstract={Smart grid is an intelligent power generation, distribution, and control system. ZigBee, as a wireless mesh networking scheme low in cost, power, data rate, and complexity, is ideal for smart grid applications, e.g., real-time system monitoring, load control, and building automation. Unfortunately, almost all ZigBee channels overlap with wireless local area network (WLAN) channels, resulting in severe performance degradation due to interference. In this paper, we aim to develop practical ZigBee deployment guideline under the interference of WLAN. We identify the “Safe Distance” and “Safe Offset Frequency” using a comprehensive approach including theoretical analysis, software simulation, and empirical measurement. In addition, we propose a frequency agility-based interference avoidance algorithm. The proposed algorithm can detect interference and adaptively switch nodes to “safe” channel to dynamically avoid WLAN interference with small latency and small energy consumption. Our proposed scheme is implemented with a Meshnetics ZigBit Development Kit and its performance is empirically evaluated in terms of the packet error rate (PER) using a ZigBee and Wi-Fi coexistence test bed. It is shown that the empirical results agree with our analytical results. The measurements demonstrate that our design guideline can efficiently mitigate the effect of WiFi interference and enhance the performance of ZigBee networks.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks have extensively been utilized over the years for ambient data collection from diverse structural deployments including mesh, ad hoc, and hierarchical layouts. Several other applications of sensor networks may involve placing the nodes in a linear topology, constituting a special class of networks called linear sensor networks. In a densely deployed linear network case, issues related to optimal resource allocation and networking may persist because the standard sensor network protocols attempt to manage the network as a mesh or ad hoc infrastructure. Issues like recovering from holes where a node cannot reach another node in either side or policies to establish a route for data dissemination need to be intelligently solved for linear sensor networks. To solve such issues, we propose a linear sensor network deployment application for oil and gas pipeline using a custom sensor board accompanied with algorithms to solve network creation, leak interrupt detection, and routing of high-priority messages with reliability while keeping network alive at all times. The proposed system provides all the features of leakage detection, localization, parameter sensing, and actuation, while operating at low energy, high data reliability, and low latencies, while comparative results prove the efficacy of the system.},

abstract={Wireless mesh networking extends the communication range among cooperating multiple low-power wireless radio transceivers and is useful for collecting data from sensors widely distributed over a large area. By integrating an off-the-shelf wireless design, such as the XBee module, development of sensor systems with mesh networking capability can be accelerated. This study introduces an open-source wireless mesh network (WMN) module, which integrates the functions of network discovery, automatic routing control, and transmission scheduling. In addition, this design is open source in order to promote the use of wireless mesh networking for environmental monitoring applications. Testing of the design and the proposed networking module is reported. The proposed wireless mesh networking module was evaluated and compared with XBee. The average package delivery ratio and standard deviation of the proposed WMN module and the XBee are 94.09%, 91.19%, 5.14%, and 10.25%, respectively, in a 20 node experiment. The proposed system was demonstrated to have the advantages of low-cost combined with high reliability and performance, and can aid scientists in implementing monitoring applications without the complications of complex wireless networking issues.},

abstract={Addressing the need for a new standard for mesh technologies, the IEEE recently approved the new mesh capability known formally as 802.11s. Once products conform to 802.11s, mesh networks can be built up using equipment from any of the Wi-Fi and wireless equipment makers, lowering costs and improving reliability. For the meantime, manufacturers will have to find ways to test their equipment for compatibility and interoperability in addition to securing final approval of the standard. However, some companies are expected to gamble on their ability to produce early products that come so close to meeting the final standard that any differences can be fixed with software updates. That would mean that mesh-capable access points may be available in stores sooner than expected.},

abstract={Wireless mesh networking is a promising technology for numerous applications which appeals especially to those applications that cannot be directly supported by other wireless technologies. The commercial success of Wi-Fi and the advances in many wireless technologies have in part stimulated the development of wireless mesh networks. The persistent driving force, however, comes from the envisioned advantages of wireless mesh techniques themselves, including extended coverage, robustness, self-configuration, easy maintenance, and low cost. This article presents an overview of this emerging technology, focusing on the technical merits and related standards activities of IEEE and ZigBee that are actively applying the concept of multi-hop mesh techniques in the field of wireless networking technologies, ranging from personal area networks (PANs) to metropolitan area networks (MANs)},

abstract={This paper introduces a new IEEE standard, IEEE 802.15.5,which provides mesh capability for wireless personal area network (WPAN) devices. The standard provides an architectural framework enabling WPAN devices to promote interoperable, stable, and scalable wireless mesh topologies. It is composed of two parts: low-rate WPAN mesh and high-rate WPAN mesh. In this paper, we present only low-rate WPAN mesh because it is designed to support wireless sensor networks. IEEE 802.15.5 low-rate part is a light-weight scalable mesh routing protocol that caters well to the requirements of resource-constrained wireless sensor networks. By binding logical addresses to the network topology, IEEE 802.15.5 obviates the need for route discovery. This eliminates the initial route discovery latency, saves storage space and reduces the communication overhead and energy consumption. A distributed link state scheme is further built atop the block addressing scheme to improve the quality of routes, robustness, and load balancing. The routing scheme scales well with regard to various performance metrics. The standard also provides enhanced functions such as multicast, reliable broadcast, power saving, time synchronization, route tracing and portability. We also present the performance evaluation of major functions performed with a 50-nodes tested deployed over a whole floor (100 × 140 ft2) at CUNY Engineering building. The results testify that the IEEE 802.15.5 will serve well for wireless personal area networks and wireless sensor networks.},
